    "## Introduction\n",
    "  Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on key risk factors.These risk factors include factors such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, family history, and physical activity, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The diabetes prediction model helps healthcare providers identify high-risk individuals early, enabling timely interventions that reduce healthcare costs and improve resource allocation. It also empowers individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles, leading to better health outcomes and savings for both healthcare departments and governments by reducing long-term treatment costs and the economic burden of diabetes.\n"

    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts an individual’s risk of developing diabetes based on key factors such as age, BMI, lifestyle choices, family history, and other health indicators. \n",
    "\n",
    " By providing healthcare providers with an accurate, data-driven tool for early risk identification, the project aims to enable timely interventions and personalized care plans, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Additionally, the model will support public health initiatives by identifying at-risk populations and helping allocate resources more effectively."

    "\n",
    "**Prepare the Data:** \n",
    "Scrape or load HTML to extract column locations, then use this information to parse a fixed-width file. Load the cleaned data into a DataFrame for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n",
    "Examine the dataset for missing values, outliers, and invalid data types. Visualize feature distributions and correlations to understand the relationships between variables and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection and Engineering:**\n",
    "Identify the most important features for prediction using statistical tests and feature importance methods. Create new features where necessary and remove irrelevant or redundant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preprocessing and Transformation:**\n",
    "Normalize or standardize numerical features and apply encoding to categorical variables. If needed, use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to simplify the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Building – Classification:**\n",
    "Start with a simple linear classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression) to establish a baseline model. Then, experiment with more complex models like decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clustering for Segmentation:**\n",
    "Apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to segment the data based on diabetes risk. Identify distinct groups that can provide deeper insights into risk profiles and patient segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning Model:**\n",
    "Implement a deep learning model like ANN to capture complex relationships in the data. Tune the model’s architecture and hyperparameters for improved predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Evaluation and Comparison:**\n",
    "Evaluate each model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall etc. Compare models based on performance and select the best one for predicting diabetes risk."

    "* Challenges for this project include data ingestion, particularly the scraping, parsing, and loading of survey data into data frames. Since the data comes from surveys, handling data quality issues such as missing values and class imbalance will be challenging. These issues can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of the model.\n",
