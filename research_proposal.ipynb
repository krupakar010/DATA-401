    "## Introduction\n",
    "In recent decades, global life expectancy has increased significantly due to advances in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. This research aims to assess the impact of gender on life expectancy using available life expectancy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The health inequality data describe life expectency with parameters like houshold gender, Household income. It is interesting to see how these play a role in overlall life expectency of people.Life expectency data is sourced from https://healthinequality.org/data/ and is publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary focus will be on comparing life expectancy between females and males. This comparative analysis aims to enhance researchers' understanding of how gender differences influence life expectancy trends. Such insights have the potential to drive advancements that improve overall life expectancy.\n"
