1. This is a regression task. Because the target variable - per capita income, is a continuous variable.
2. 
 False. OLS is not a type of model but an optimization algorithm.
 False. Even if a model doesnâ€™t meet some assumptions, there are ways to fix this up.
 False. Estimation refers to the process of determining the coefficients of the features in the training phase. Prediction is to determine the value of the outcome variable using a previously unseen feature value.
 True.
3) There are six core assumptions:

The model is correctly specified.
The error term has a mean of 0 (a consequence of the exogeneity assumption).
The error term is uncorrelated with the regressors (also a consequence of the exogeneity assumption).
The error term has constant variance across all observations (in other words, there's homoscedasticity).
The errors are uncorrelated between observations (in other words, there's no autocorrelation).
The predictors are linearly independent (in other words, there's no perfect multicollinearity).
